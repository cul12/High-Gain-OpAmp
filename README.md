# High-Gain-OpAmp
## Overview
Designed a two-stage Operational Amplifier with Miller Frequency Compensation to enhance stability and ensure reliable performance across a wide range of frequencies. The amplifier achieves a high gain and a broad unity-gain bandwidth (UGB), making it suitable for various analog signal processing applications. The design process included a detailed analysis of poles and phase margin to ensure stability.
